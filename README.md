# Introduction
Personal Introduction:

Hi, I am Rahul Bankey, pursuing my Master's in BAIS from the University of South Florida. Before joining USF, I was part of two multinational companies, IBM and Unisys, where I worked as a Mirosoft Analyst and Application Developer. My major achievement is that I have established the DICE (Data Intelligence Center of Excellence) at Bangalore International Airport, which was the first in the Indian Aviation Domain. Apart from the full-time work, I also did my summer internship at KOCH Industries as a Data Engineer Intern, where I handled a computer vision-based use case called Dixie Cup Bottom Inspection'. My technical acqumen includes Python, SQL, ML, Data Science, statistics, and PowerBI, which I want to use to contribute to a team that is much more focused on society and has a great impact on the environment.
